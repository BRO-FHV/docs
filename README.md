## <a name="Description"></a>Description
This is the documentation for our operating system for ressource limited systems. The basic goal was to implement an OS on a beaglebone bare metal. The basic points are:  

- a monolitic kernel
- applications in php and c
- an event driven application layer 
- use network for communication via TCP and HTTP
- HTML/CSS/JS (client-side) will be delivered to the client and communicate via ajax with the application

Ultimately we should have a light controll and manage the lights in the browser.
