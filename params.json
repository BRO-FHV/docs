The basic goal was to implement an OS on a beaglebone bare metal. The basic points are:  \r\n\r\n- a monolitic kernel\r\n- applications in php and c\r\n- an event driven application layer \r\n- use network for communication via TCP and HTTP\r\n- HTML/CSS/JS (client-side) will be delivered to the client and communicate via ajax with the application\r\n\r\nUltimately we should have a light controll and manage the lights in the browser.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"CurrentState\"></a>Current State\r\nThe current state of the project contains:\r\n\r\n- a hardware abstraction layer \r\n- drivers for LEDs, GPIO, Serial Port, Timer\r\n- memory managment\r\n- file system\r\n- elf loader\r\n- process scheduler\r\n- library for client applications to communicate with the os\r\n- ethernet component with udp\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"Todo\"></a>Todo\r\n- porting of LWIP to use TCP/IP which is needed for PHP\r\n- porting of PHP\r\n- implementation of the DMX driver\r\n- refactoring of the HAL :D\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"Team\"></a>Team\r\n\r\n- [Thomas Gaida](https://github.com/thomasgaida)\r\n- [Stefan Lässer](https://github.com/sla89)\r\n- [Johannes Schwendinger](https://github.com/jotschgl)\r\n- [Johannes Wachter](https://github.com/wachterjohannes)\r\n- [Michael Zangerle](https://github.com/michaelzangerle)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
