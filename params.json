The basic goal was to implement an OS on a beaglebone bare metal. The basic points are:  \r\n\r\n- a monolitic kernel\r\n- applications in php and c\r\n- an event driven application layer \r\n- use network for communication via TCP and HTTP\r\n- HTML/CSS/JS (client-side) will be delivered to the client and communicate via ajax with the application\r\n\r\nUltimately we should have a light controll and manage the lights in the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Team\r\n- [Thomas Gaida](https://github.com/thomasgaida)\r\n- [Stefan Lässer](https://github.com/sla89)\r\n- [Johannes Schwendinger](https://github.com/jotschgl)\r\n- [Johannes Wachter](https://github.com/wachterjohannes)\r\n- [Michael Zangerle](https://github.com/michaelzangerle)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
